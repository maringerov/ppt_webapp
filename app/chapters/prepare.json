In most cases, it is limited to acquiring information about a certain predefined topic, going to a computer and starting the presentation software.

If it is considered at all.<\/p>  <blockquote>Most presenters underestimate preparation.<\/blockquote>  <p>When you want to create and deliver a great learning experience you have to realize that you need to put effort into preparing, before you start designing the content of your presentation. You have to adopt a mindset similar to the one when working on a report - all the work must be done before the actual writing starts.<\/p>"
